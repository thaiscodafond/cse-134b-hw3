                  This was a magnetic propulsion train project made by myself
                  and a classmate for the TIPE (French national exam to get into
                  Engineering school). We built a small train, containing a
                  magnet, passing through a coil. A current is sent through the
                  coil when the train is placed, and a magnetic field is formed.
                  This magnetic field creates potential energy. This propulses
                  the train. However, if we kept the current running in the same
                  direction, the train would get stuck in the middle of the
                  coil. We thus built a bread board which is capable of
                  analyzing the signal of the current and detecting when the
                  train gets close enough, to then reverse the current.

                  IMT Atlantique wanted to implement, in the program of the
                  first year (1A), a new teaching unit dedicated to the Internet
                  of Things and machine learning. For this, the school asked us
                  to make a facial recognition software using an M5Stack AI
                  camera, a second ESP-EYE DevKit camera and an M5Stack
                  development kit. The work carried out made it possible to
                  create a facial recognition algorithm using machine learning
                  modules. It used computer knowledge such as the Sobel method
                  and edge detection algorithms.

                  Bee Friendly is a non-profit association that manages the Bee
                  Friendly label, which labels products produced using
                  bee-friendly practices. In order to facilitate contact between
                  labeled farmers and verified beekeepers, the association
                  wished to have a web interface. The interface would allow
                  farmers to fill in the calendar of their interventions,
                  beekeepers to ask farmers in their region for access to this
                  calendar, and to fill in the location of their hives in the
                  database. Me and my group's project consisted in developing
                  this interface, as well as the back-end infrastructure
                  allowing its proper functioning. A forum and a messaging
                  system have also been implemented. I mostly focused on the CSS
                  and the PHP for this project.
